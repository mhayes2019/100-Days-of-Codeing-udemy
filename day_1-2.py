#first you can do your input fucntion to ask the user whatever question you want. 
#I was not sure on how to print the length of the characters for whatever the user choose to type so I googled it. I googled "How to print the number of characters in a users input for python"
#first I need to assign a variable to the output
#then in order to print the length of whatever the user types I will need to use the len() function. 
#I will need to use the print() function first then I will need to nest the len()function into the print function. When I type out the len() function inside the paraenthese of len I will put what I would like it to get the length of and in this case I want it to get the length of what the user input and then print it to the screen
user = input("What is your name?")
print(len(user))

print(len(input("What is your nickname?")))
